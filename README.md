## About

indieTube is a crowd-sourced filter using YouTube's [Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) to show only independent content creators and filter out everything else. Check it out [here](https://indietube.netlify.app)!

## Technologies

-   React.js
-   Styled-Components / CSS
-   [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
-   Sketch
-   Netlify Forms

## Problem

Over the years, YouTube has transitioned from a community-driven site with independent creators at the forefront, to an overly-corporatized, advertisement controlled platform where the indie content creators are buried under page after page of corporations.

## Action

I decided to build a simple client-side React web application to address the issue for myself (and hopefully others) that consumes YouTube's Data API, filters the results, and allows the user to flag results that are not indie if they see any.

## Result

indieTube is actively being used by several people, including myself, to search YouTube when the search term is expected to be full of corporate results. It works, it's simple, and it solves a problem that I no longer have to deal with. üëç
