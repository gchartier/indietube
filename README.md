[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e73bb3aa-4063-4b5f-bd5a-1745cc9bbf4f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/indietube/deploys)

## About

indieTube is a crowd-sourced filter using YouTube's [Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) to show only independent content creators and filter out everything else. Check it out [here](https://indietube.netlify.app)!

## Technologies Used

-   React.js
-   Styled-Components / CSS
-   [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
-   Designed in Sketch
-   Netlify Forms

## Problem

Over the years, YouTube has transitioned from a community-driven site with independent creators at the forefront, to an overly-corporatized, advertisement controlled platform where the indie content creators are buried under page after page of corporations.

## Action

I decided to build a React web application to address the issue for myself (and hopefully others) that consumes YouTube's Data API, filters the results, and allows the user to flag results that are not "indie" if they see any.

## Result

indieTube can be used today to search YouTube when the search term is expected to be full of results from corporations. It works, it's simple, and it solves a problem that I no longer have to deal with. üëç

## Future Developments

-   Clean up UI
-   Add a dark mode
-   Preserve results when visiting other pages
-   Replace "not indie" alert dialog with disappearing message
-   Automate updating of filter
